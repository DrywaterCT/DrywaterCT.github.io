## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2
Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs since at this time it was a lot more simpler, the lab also only had one part. I was also partnered with Lorenzo who I’ve had a class with before so it was nice to see a familiar face. I also learned from Lorenzo since he’s good at all of this and I was new at this and still learning.

Lab 4
I enjoyed lab 4 because it was the first lab where I really put what I learned to use, since before I was doing more learning and watching. My partner Shelby was helpful as well since she knew other people who could help us as well. This is where I understood what “double” really did and the proper format for “std::cout”.

Lab 6, Part 1
Lab 6 was enjoyable other than the fact that it got deleted and we had to do everything again last minute. My partner Hung made it more bearable since we met up outside of class and finished what we could. This lab was more simple and I learned how to use “command_line.at(1)”.
